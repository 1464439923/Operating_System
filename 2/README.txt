Description:
In this project, we need to implement a CPU scheduler in Operating System.

How to run:
1. in this directory use Makefile to make executable file: sched
$ make

2. use sched to produce output into /out directory
./runit.sh out ./sched

3. compare our output with the reference output
./gradeit.sh refout out
